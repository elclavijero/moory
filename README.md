# Moory
Welcome to the Moory gem!

You can use this gem to create various kinds of finite machines using a simple specification language.

Until I can get some tutorial material together, please take a look at the examples directory.  Therein you'll find a Finite Acceptor, a Decoder (Mealy machine), and something useless but (hopefully) illuminating.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'moory'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install moory

## Usage

Please see the examples directory, for now.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
